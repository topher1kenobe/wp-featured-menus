## Description ##

Provides a metabox on posts and pages listing existing WordPress Menus.  The end user is allowed to choose one and make it associated with the post or page via meta data.

## Installation ##

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `wp-featured-menus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create new or Edit a Post.

## Usage ##

Page or Post meta has a key called `_wp_featured_menu`.  A very simple way to render the menu is like this:

`<?php
	$meta = get_post_custom();
	wp_nav_menu( array( 'menu' => $meta['_wp_featured_menu'][0] ) );
?>`

A better way might be to test for the value first:

`<?php
	$meta = get_post_custom();
	if ( is_numeric( $meta['_wp_featured_menu'][0] ) ) {
		wp_nav_menu( array( 'menu' => $meta['_wp_featured_menu'][0] ) );
	}
?>`
